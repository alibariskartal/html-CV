    <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>I have over 10 years of experience as a mechanical engineer in different positions. After my graduation my first job was about TSE (Turkish Standards Institution) 
        and CE certification in a consulting firm. </p>
        <p>That’s followed by a sub-industry company producing parts for automobile factories. I worked in the logistic department for a few months. </p>
        <p>After this short experiece I started my new job as a production engineer in “Machine and Technology Factory”, connected to “Mechanical and Chemical Industry 
        Corporation”. Which is a specialized company known for its reputation in the defense industry. After 2 years in there i’m assigned to work in both production
         and R&D departments.</p>
        <p>During my time in R&D i took part in both production of prototypes as well as control of documentation. That includes quality, configuration, project management plans,
         product tree, technical specifications, interface control documents,  technical data packages and test and evaluation master plans.</p>
        <p>And finally my last station, Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism ! I’m currently working as a control engineer. My department is responsible of 
        reconstruction & restoration of ancient historical buildings. I am basically working on hvac and fire systems in these projects. Controlling both, 
        projects as well as implementations of them. (It’s really cool, we are bringing history to life !)</p>
        <p>What i love about my job is, to be able to work in different sectors and departments. I’m a quick learner and also an open minded person to always learn new things.
        So even if any of my experience doesn’t cover what you are looking for but you feel like i can be a good potential, send me an invitation to connect and let’s talk.
         I’d love to work together if your job (sector) also gets my attention too !</p>
